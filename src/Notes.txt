import React from 'react';
import { downloadAUrl } from 'better-file-downloader';

export default function example() {
  const download = async (url) => {
    await downloadAUrl(url, {
      fileName: 'example-file',
      extension: '.pdf',
      contentType: 'application/pdf',
    });
  };

  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() =>
        download('https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-uploaded-files/images/cat.jpg')
      }
    >

    </button>
  );
}
